##Linear motion parts for OpenBuilds linear rail

I have constructed several linear motion devices using OpenBuilds linear rail and commercially printed 3D parts.

The wiki has more information about using some of the designs listed below. The wiki may be found here: https://github.com/mhgreen/openbuilds-parts/wiki

#### bearing-mount

The bearing mount is intended to be used with a 19mm outside diameter bearing that is 7mm thick. The inside diameters that I have used are 8mm and 10mm depending on the lead screw or shaft size. The mount is sized for a thrust bearing with an 18mm outside diameter to be placed on top.

#### NEMA17 mount

The NEMA17 mount is placed on the end of a piece of OpenBuilds linear rail or Makerslide. The stepper mount is sized to work with the bearing mount.

#### 13mm bearing brackets

This is a pair of brackets for 20 tooth MXL or GT2 timing pulleys. A left and right bearing bracket are attached to the ends of OpenBuilds rail. Thrust bearings and shaft collars keep the shafts positioned.

An example assembly and bill of materials can be found in the end support assembly folder (see below).

#### NEMA 17 extended mount

Used with a dual shaft NEMA 17 stepper to drive belts using the 13mm bearing brackets. Mounted on Misumi 5 series extrusions with brackets. There is an example assembly and picture in the part folder. Mounted to extrusion with four Misumi brackets: http://us.misumi-ec.com/vona2/detail/110300437260/?HissuCode=HBLFSN5&PNSearch=HBLFSN5&Keyword=HBLFSN5.

### Example assemblies

Here are some example assemblies to show how the parts work together.

#### v-slot belt Y

An assembly showing how the NEMA 17 extended mount can be used with the bearing brackets to drive a Y axis.

SDP/SI part numbers for long shaft and 5/6 mm shaft coupler.

Description | Part
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------
6 (-.004/-.012) Dia, 280mm Long, 416 Stainless Steel Shaft | http://www.sdp-si.com/eStore/Catalog/PartNumber/S40PX0MHG6M-280
Slit Type Plastic Couplings, 5 / 6mm Bores, 28mm Overall Length, Coupling Material: Plastic | http://www.sdp-si.com/eStore/Catalog/PartNumber/S50TLCM19H05H06

The smaller 18mm coupler can also be used and shaft length depends on desired x axis width.

Detail for using the bearing brackets. There is an assembly example and picture in this folder. This is a detailed look at the assemblies contained in the v-slot-belt Y example.
