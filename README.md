##Linear motion parts for OpenBuilds linear rail

I have constructed several linear motion devices using OpenBuilds linear rail and commercially printed 3D parts. for the most part, this has worked well. The most consistent parts, in terms of dimensional accuracy, have been from Ponoko.

#### bearing-mount

The bearing mount is intended to be used with a 19mm outside diameter bearing that is 7mm thick. The inside diameters that I have used are 8mm and 10mm depending on the lead screw or shaft size. The mount is sized for a thrust bearing with an 18mm outside diameter to be placed on top.

#### NEMA17 mount

The NEMA17 mount is placed on the end of a piece of OpenBuilds linear rail or Makerslide. The stepper mount is sized to work with the bearing mount.

#### 13mm bearing brackets

This is a pair of brackets for 20 tooth MXL or GT2 timing pulleys. A left and right bearing bracket are attached to the ends of OpenBuilds rail. Thrust bearings and shaft collars keep the shafts positioned. There is an example assembly picture and Inventor assembly in the part folder.

One source for MXL timing pulleys, shafts and couplers is SDP/SI: http://www.sdp-si.com/eStore/Catalog. A source for threaded hex standoffs is McMaster: http://www.mcmaster.com/

#### NEMA 17 extended mount

Used with a dual shaft NEMA 17 stepper to drive belts using the 13mm bearing brackets. Mounted on Misumi 5 series extrusions with brackets. There is an example assembly and picture in the part folder.

### Example assemblies

Here are some example assemblies to show how the parts work together.
