##Linear motion parts for OpenBuilds linear rail

###I have constructed several linear motion devices using OpenBuilds linear rail and commercially printed 3D parts. for the most part, this has worked well. The most consistent parts, in terms of dimensional accuracy, have been from Ponoko.

### bearing-mount

The bearing mount is intended to be used with a 19mm outside diameter bearing that is 7mm thick. The inside diameters that I have used are 8mm and 10mm depending on the lead screw or shaft size. The mount is sized for a thrust bearing with an 18mm outside diameter to be placed on top.

### NEMA17 mount

The NEMA17 mount is placed on the end of a piece of OpenBuilds linear rail or Makerslide. The stepper mount is sized to work with the bearing mount.
